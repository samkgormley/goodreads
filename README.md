# Goodreads
## Motivation
This project’s motivation was to visualise trends in my reading history and habits.

I have been a Goodreads user since 2015, using it to keep track of the books that I have read and the dates between which I read them.

## Methodology
The wrangling and cleaning of the dataset was performed using Python’s pandas library.
The visualisation was performed using Tableau.

You can export your own Goodreads data to replicate my methodology by following [these steps](https://help.goodreads.com/s/article/How-do-I-import-or-export-my-books-1553870934590).

## Outputs
The completed Tableau dashboard can be found on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/sam.gormley#!/vizhome/goodreads_16153181076770/Goodreads).
A screenshot of the dashboard is also located in this repository [here](goodreads.md).
